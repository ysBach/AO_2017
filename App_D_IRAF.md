This short lecture note is used as a material for the "legacy session" which uses IRAF. For basic concepts and ideas (e.g., reason for flat division, etc), please refer to the other lecture note sections.

This time, you will learn very basic tasks of IRAF. This includes


* Print information of images (``IMSTAT``, ``CCDLIST``, ``IMHEADER``,``HSELECT``)
* Arithmetics on images: copying an image and adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing an image with others (``IMCOPY``,``IMARITH``) 
* Combining: make master bias, dark, and flat (``IMCOMBINE``)
* Preprocessing

Then


* Primitive photometry (``IMEXAM``, ``DAOEDIT``)
* Aperture photometry (``PHOT``)
* Spectroscopic data reduction (``APALL``, ``IDENTIFY``, ``REIDENTIFY``, ``FITCOORDS``, ``SENSFUNC``, ``FLUXCALIB``)

I will explain the usage of IRAF/PyRAF in conda environment, so it may slightly differ from normal IRAF, but basically the same.

## 1. Run PyRAF

You can start IRAF environment (*not* IRAF itself!) by typing

    $ source activate iraf

on the terminal. `iraf` is the name of conda environment you set when creating the environment, and you may have used `iraf27`, etc. Then you are now in the IRAF environment run on Python 2.7. At a suitable directory, type

    $ mkiraf

and answer the question with `xgterm`. Typing `ls` will show you `login.cl` and `uparms` directory. `login.cl` is the file which saves basic properties: It's a *settings* file in short. It will be used when you run IRAF **in this directory only**. You have to run the IRAF in the directory where you have `login.cl`. `uparms` is a directory which will save the changes you make to the default settings of IRAF.

Now, you can run IRAF by typing
​    
    $ cl

or run PyRAF by typing

    $ pyraf
I recommend to use PyRAF, since AstroConda does not fully guarantee the stability of IRAF CL. The `IMEXAM`, for example, does not correctly work if you use `cl`. You will see the following on terminal with the prompt "`-->`":

![IRAF_01](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_01.png)

- **NOTE**:

  1. Change all the names to “.fits”, NOT “.fit”

  2. All the images should have header ``BZERO`` and ``BSCALE``. *If they don't*, type the following on the cl terminal:

     ```
     --> noao
     --> imred
     --> ccdred
     --> ccdhedit *.fits BZERO 32768
     --> ccdhedit *.fits BSCALE 1
     ```

     This might be necessary for images obtained from some personal ccds. The real pixel value should be ``real_value = pixel * BSCALE + BZERO``. People sacrificed the 15th bit of 16-bit system, and used it as a “sign” bit. Usually, ``BZERO = 2**15 = 32768``, and ``BSCALE=1.0``. If you do not add these header keywords to the image header, you will result in many negative values from bias/dark/flat raw images, which eventually lead you to a wrong result. For more information, please see the [astropy documentation](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/#unsigned-integers). 

     ​

## 2. Display Image

PyRAF supports few LINUX commands, such as `ls` or `cd` without an exclamation mark (`!`). But to display image, you must use `!ds9` or `!ginga`. You should also use (`!`) when delete files using `rm`. 

Since IRAF is extremely comfortable when used with `SAO ds9`, I will use `ds9` throughout this note.

### SAO DS9

Display the image:

* **TIP**: It's better to append the ampersand (`&`) at the end of `ds9`. Try without it and see what happens.
* **TIP**: Always try to use `tab` key on your keyboard to "autocomplete"!

![IRAF_02](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_02.png)

In the `HR30/` directory, you have four images and `bias/` and `flat/` directories. The four images are the real images. I first will make master bias and flat.

### IRAF ``IMPLOT``

There are many plotting packages in IRAF too, e.g., [``IMPLOT``](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?implot), for image display, and [``SPLOT``](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?splot), for spectrum display:

```
--> implot vega_7s.fits
```

![IRAF_implot](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_implot.png)

Click on the ``Graphics`` window, and hit ``:`` key, then you will see small box at the bottom of the window. The left image is obtained by typing ``:a 30`` and then ``:l 700`` (average over 30 pixels around line (row) 700), and the right image is obtained by ``:a 30`` and then ``:c 500``. On the images, there will be a small T-shaped tick on the right y-axis (red arrows). This indicates which line/column you are looking at.



## 3. Bias Combine

First, make the list of bias files. Go to the bias directory by "`--> cd bias`" and type

    --> ls *.fits > bias.list
This will make a file `bias.list` containing the list of all files that are bias. 

* **QUESTION**: Try what happens when you do ``ls bias* > bias.list`` (delete ``.fits``). Open the ``bias.list``file, and you will find something happened. Why?

Then

    --> epar imcombine

`epar` means "edit parameters. The task `IMCOMBINE` will do task of combining images using many options. 

We will combine all 12 images in the `bias/` directory, and make one output named `bias.fits` using so-called **median combine**, while all other options left as default:

![IRAF_bias_combine](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_bias_combine.png)

In IRAF commands, `@filename` means "open the file named `filename`, and put the contents here". Since `bias.list` contains the list of file names of bias images, 

    @bias.list == KCD095601.fits, KCD095602.fits, ....... , KCD095627.fits

See how efficient it is?

Clicking `Execute`, you will see that a new file appeared. Check it by 

    --> !ds9 -zscale bias.fits &
In this tutorial, we will neglect the dark, because it is extremely small compared to that of bias and almost constant over the image in modern CCDs. **So regard this master bias as "bias+dark".** If you have dark frames and want to make master dark frame, you can just do the same procedure for the dark frame images with identical exposure times (e.g., make ``dark10s.list``, ``dark100s.list``, etc).



## 4. Flat Combine

To make master flat, you have to subtract master bias from combined flat image. All are identical as that of bias, but subtract master bias from the final combined flat.

    --> cd ../flat/
    --> ls *.fits > flat.list
    --> epar imcombine

I want to make the combined image as `flat0.fits` first. Then save the result of subtracting bias, i.e., "`flat0 - bias`", as `flat.fits`. Do the median combine first:

![IRAF_flat_combine](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_flat_combine.png)

Now copy the master bias to here and subtract it from the combined flat:

    --> cp ../bias/bias.fits .
    --> imarith flat0.fits - bias.fits flat.fits
    --> !ds9 -zscale flat.fits &

It's very intuitive: "``IMARITH image1 operator image2 output``" means do the operation (``operator`` can be ``+, -, *, /``) to images (``image1``, ``image2``) and save the result as "``output``". ``IMARITH`` of course means image arithmetics. You can open the full options window as you did for ``IMCOMBINE`` by typing

    --> epar imarith
​    



## 5. Preprocessing

### ``IMUTIL`` Package

Preprocessing is simply "(raw image - master bias)/(master flat)". 

    --> cd ..
    --> cp bias/bias.fits .
    --> cp flat/flat.fits .
    --> ls
    bias  bias.fits  flat  flat.fits  KCD095628.fits  KCD095629.fits  KCD095630.fits  KCD095631.fits

Conceptually what we have to do is first 

    --> imarith object_image - bias.fits output1

and then do 

    --> imarith output1 / flat.fits output2

Because we have 4 images, which is few, you can do this for each of image. However, there is cleverer way to do it.

    --> ls KCD*.fits > obj.list
    --> cp obj.list output1.list
    --> cp obj.list output2.list
    --> !perl -pi -e "s/KCD/b_KCD/g" output1.list
    --> !perl -pi -e "s/KCD/bf_KCD/g" output2.list
    --> imarith @obj.list - bias.fits @output1.list
    --> imarith @output1.list / flat.fits @output2.list
    --> ls
    bf_KCD095628.fits  bias              b_KCD095630.fits  KCD095628.fits  obj.list
    bf_KCD095629.fits  bias.fits	     b_KCD095631.fits  KCD095629.fits  output1.list
    bf_KCD095630.fits  b_KCD095628.fits  flat              KCD095630.fits  output2.list
    bf_KCD095631.fits  b_KCD095629.fits  flat.fits         KCD095631.fits

Here, `perl -pi -e` command is used for changing all the strings "`KCD`" to "`b_KCD`" or "`bf_KCD`":

    perl -pi -e "s/string1/string2/g" filename
                 ^ ^       ^          ^

First `s` means we will change the strings, **from "`string1`" to "`string2`"**, within the file `filename`. I used `b` for bias corrected, and `bf` for bias and flat corrected. You can display all the images

    --> !ds9 -zscale bf_*.fits -single &

* **TIP**: Hit `tab` key and the next image will be displayed. 
* **TIP**: When do the flat fielding, I did not normalized it to have average value = 1. See the next section's **Question**.
* **Question**: Hit `tab` key several times. Can you find something? What do you think it is?



### ``CCDRED`` package

There are some tasks which are made especially for bias, dark, and flat combine processes. They are called `ZEROCOMBINE`, `DARKCOMBINE`, and `FLATCOMBINE`, which are subtasks of ``CCDRED``. They are all small variants of ``COMBINE`` (different from ``IMCOIMBINE``), and run through ``CCDPROC`` task. 

I usually avoid teaching these because it veils what's happening in IRAF, and thus not very good for educational purpose. But I am showing you how to use these tasks, since it may be necessary for your future work. Manuals are kindly available from STScI: Just google with keywords such as "iraf zerocombine" and you will find the STScI website manuals like [this](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?zerocombine).

 

#### ``ZEROCOMBINE``

For bias (zero) combine, use the following settings:

![IRAF_zerocombine](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_zerocombine.png)

* Many students fails to do it because they put something in ``ccdtype``. Let it be blank unless header information is correctly set!
* Don't bother to much for ``rdnoise`` and ``gain``, since they are used only for ``reject==ccdclip`` or ``reject==crreject``. See the [Zerocombine Manual](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?zerocombine).



#### ``DARKCOMBINE``

For dark combine, use the following settings:

![IRAF_darkcombine](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_darkcombine.png)

* Please let ``ccdtype`` blank as before.

* Don't bother to much for ``rdnoise`` and ``gain``, since they are used only for ``reject==ccdclip`` or ``reject==crreject``. See the [Darkcombine Manual](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?darkcombine).

* ``process`` means it will do the bias subtraction (``zerocor`` of ``CCDPROC`` task). ``scale`` means it will scale the dark images to the exposure time, and combine all darks appropriately.

* The zero-corrected dark may have negative values and the mean is around 0.

  ​

>If you do ``DARKCOMBINE``, the input dark files may be changed (automatically zero subtracted). If you type ``--> ccdlist``, you can see [Z] to each dark files, which means the zero correction has already been done. This can be avoided by using ``CCDPROC``: 
>
>```
>--> epar ccdproc
>```
>
>set: ``input=@dark.list, (output)=dark.fits, (zerocor)=yes, (zero)=bias.fits.`` See below:
>
>![IRAF_ccdproc_zerocor](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_ccdproc_zerocor.png)
>
>Or ``COMBINE`` or ``IMCOMBINE`` to get the median-combined dark, and then subtract ``bias.fits`` by I``MARITH``:
>
>    --> combine dark*.fits tmp.fits combine=median
>    --> imarith tmp.fits – Zero.fits Dark.fits
>
>Of course ``(IM)COMBINE`` and ``IMARITH`` all can be controlled by using ``epar`` (``epar combine``, etc) as before. If you have better ways to do this, please let the TA know T__T



#### ``FLATCOMBINE``

For dark combine, use the following settings:

![IRAF_flatcombine](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_flatcombine.png)

* Please let ``ccdtype`` blank as before.
* Don't bother to much for ``rdnoise`` and ``gain``, since they are used only for ``reject==ccdclip`` or ``reject==crreject``. See the [Flatcombine Manual](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?flatcombine).
* Now we have to think about ``subset`` option. Since flat should be differentiated by filters, slits (spectroscopy), etc, IRAF scans the headers and automatically subdivide the flats into several groups. Sometimes it does not work properly.
* ``scale`` means it will normalize the flat image by its mode, average, etc. 

>If you use ``CCDPROC``, ``input=@flat.list, (output)=flat.fits, (zerocor)=yes, (darkcor)=yes (zero)=bias.fits (dark)=dark.fits`` is required.





## 6. File Information

You may want to see the brief information, such as statistics or the so-called "header information", of images. You can do this via many ways.


### Statistics from IRAF

There is a task named `IMSTATISTICS` which gives some statistics for each image:

    --> imstatistics *.fits
    #               IMAGE      NPIX      MEAN    STDDEV       MIN       MAX
           KCD095628.fits   4194304     5590.     2655.     4098.    65354.
           KCD095629.fits   4194304     5599.     2662.     4111.    65349.
           KCD095630.fits   4194304     5582.     2643.     4116.    65361.
           KCD095631.fits   4194304     5574.     2666.     4116.    65358.
         b_KCD095628.fits   4194304     1395.     2307.      -59.    61141.
         b_KCD095629.fits   4194304     1403.     2315.      -46.    61143.
         b_KCD095630.fits   4194304     1386.     2293.     -44.5    61145.
         b_KCD095631.fits   4194304     1378.     2319.      -43.    61141.
        bf_KCD095628.fits   4194304   0.07362    0.1266    -3.118     3.335
        bf_KCD095629.fits   4194304   0.07374    0.1271    -2.826     3.402
        bf_KCD095630.fits   4194304   0.07279    0.1263      -3.6     3.402
        bf_KCD095631.fits   4194304    0.0726    0.1273    -3.118       3.4
                bias.fits   4194304     4196.     1345.     4141.    65275.
                flat.fits   4194304    18973.     1960.       8.5    40058.

* **Question**: Why do you think the results `bf_*.fits` have such low min/max values? Do you have better idea to cope with this issue? This becomes bothersome for IRAF sometimes: see `DAOEDIT` section below.
* **Question**: From file explorer, you can see the sizes of each image. The original `KCD*.fits` images are about 8.4 MB while the newly generated images are about twice larger. Why do you think this is so?
* **TIP**: If you do the flat fielding, etc, by using some tasks for several times, you may see the file size increases. If this happened, you are now not even be able to do basic arithmetics for the images (error message will contain something like ``FXF~~~``). This is because IRAF automatically makes a new "extention" on top of the original file, not overwriting it. You must delete the original file and do the reduction again.


### Header from ds9
On `ds9`, you can click on `file -> header` to see all the header contents.

### Header from IRAF
You can use `IMHEADER`:

    --> imheader *.fits
    KCD095628.fits[2048,2048][ushort]: P/2006HR30
    KCD095629.fits[2048,2048][ushort]: P/2006HR30
    KCD095630.fits[2048,2048][ushort]: P/2006HR30
    KCD095631.fits[2048,2048][ushort]: P/2006HR30
    b_KCD095628.fits[2048,2048][real]: P/2006HR30
    b_KCD095629.fits[2048,2048][real]: P/2006HR30
    b_KCD095630.fits[2048,2048][real]: P/2006HR30
    b_KCD095631.fits[2048,2048][real]: P/2006HR30
    bf_KCD095628.fits[2048,2048][real]: P/2006HR30
    bf_KCD095629.fits[2048,2048][real]: P/2006HR30
    bf_KCD095630.fits[2048,2048][real]: P/2006HR30
    bf_KCD095631.fits[2048,2048][real]: P/2006HR30
    bias.fits[2048,2048][real]: bias
    flat.fits[2048,2048][real]: flat

The result is slightly different from IRAF, because of the Python nature. If you want to see the full header, you can do:

    --> imheader KCD095628.fits lo+

which means "long+". If you want to see only the exposure time, for example, which is `EXPTIME` in header keyword, you can use "`| grep`":
    --> imheader *.fits lo+ | grep 'EXPTIME'
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                120.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                  0.0 / [sec] Total integration time
    EXPTIME =                 10.0 / [sec] Total integration time

More flexibility comes with `HSELECT` which means header select:

    --> hselect *.fits "$I, EXPTIME, UT" yes
    KCD095628.fits	120.0	11:04:53
    KCD095629.fits	120.0	11:09:00
    KCD095630.fits	120.0	11:13:15
    KCD095631.fits	120.0	11:17:22
    b_KCD095628.fits	120.0	11:04:53
    b_KCD095629.fits	120.0	11:09:00
    b_KCD095630.fits	120.0	11:13:15
    b_KCD095631.fits	120.0	11:17:22
    bf_KCD095628.fits	120.0	11:04:53
    bf_KCD095629.fits	120.0	11:09:00
    bf_KCD095630.fits	120.0	11:13:15
    bf_KCD095631.fits	120.0	11:17:22
    bias.fits	0.0	09:30:25
    flat.fits	10.0	19:27:15

You may understand what this task gets and gives. `I` is for "inputs", and it prints the filenames.


### `CCDLIST`
There is another useful tool similar to `IMHEADER` If you have used `ZEROCOMBINE`, `DARKCOMBINE`,  and `FLATCOMBINE`. It will show you which preprocesses have been done for each image. But since we used `IMARITH` only, this result will be almost identical to that of `IMHEADER` and no more information will be there. To use `CCDLIST`, you have to activate some packages:

    --> imred
    imred/:
     argus/         ctioslit/       hydra/          kpnocoude/      vtel/
     bias/          dtoi/           iids/           kpnoslit/
     ccdred/        echelle/        irred/          quadred/
     crutil/        generic/        irs/            specred/
    --> ccdred
    ccdred/:

## 7. Primitive Photometry

### `IMEXAMINE`
For photometry, let's use `IMEXAM` first. IRAF becomes extremely powerful when you use the interactive mode with the aid of `SAO ds9`. 

    --> !ds9 bf_KCD095628.fits &
    --> imexam

If you type `imexam`, your mouse cursor will blink. Put cursor on a star you are interested in, and hit `a` key. On terminal, you will see the information:

    #   COL    LINE     COORDINATES
    #     R    MAG    FLUX     SKY    PEAK    E   PA BETA ENCLOSED   MOFFAT DIRECT
    1034.81 1036.09 1034.81 1036.09
       8.36  23.77   3.093 0.06386  0.3435 0.21  -80 4.83     2.34     2.94   2.79

The meaning of the result is explained at STScI manual website ([here](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?imexamine)). The lines starting with `#` are comment lines, and they correspond to the next lines composed of numbers, which indicate the corresponding parameter. In the above, for example, the sky is estimated to be 0.05386 and the star flux is 3.093, with Moffat-fitted FWHM 2.94.

Hitting `r` will show you the radial profile of the star from the photocenter. `s` shows the surface plot. These may be useful if you do the psf photometry in the future using IRAF.

In the interactive mode, you can exit by hitting `q` key. Hit `?` key to see the manual or help on the terminal. You can scroll down with `enter` key and escape by hitting the `q` key. The manual here is a short version of the website version.


### `DAOEDIT`
In `DIGIPHOT.DAOPHOT`, there are many tasks. Quite many people do use the stand alone version ([see here](http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/DAOphot)). Since we will *not* use IRAF intensively throughout this semester, I will just briefly mention the tasks. First type "`daophot`" and you will see:

    --> daophot
    daophot/:
     addstar        daotest         nstar           pexamine        psf
     allstar        datapars@       pcalc           pfmerge         psort
     centerpars@    findpars@       pconcat         phot            pstselect
     daoedit        fitskypars@     pconvert        photpars@       seepsf
     daofind        group           pdump           prenumber       setimpars
     daopars@       grpselect       peak            pselect         substar

As an example, I measured few of the stars in the image by hitting `a` key on the image:

    --> !ds9 bf_KCD095628.fits &
    --> daoedit bf_KCD095628.fits
    Warning: Graphics overlay not available for display device.
    
    # XCENTER YCENTER       SKY SKYSIGMA    FWHM   COUNTS     MAG
      1034.76 1036.13       0.1     0.00    2.99      2.9  -1.138
      1007.33  990.14       0.1     0.00    3.01      0.8   0.199
      1016.51 1004.80       0.1     0.00    2.90      0.2   1.752
      1048.00  942.55       0.1     0.00    3.04      2.0  -0.767
      1074.63  939.88       0.1     0.00    3.02      1.2  -0.221
      1136.91  947.06       0.1     0.00    2.97      4.6  -1.652

Hit `r` to check whether the star is saturated. Hit `?` to see help, as usual.

In the previous **Question**, I asked you what will happen if the min/max values of the image is too small. Now you see the problem: Due to the default decimal point print of `DAOEDIT`, `SKY` and `SKYSIGMA` (representative sky value and its error) are unrealistic. In reality, this should be something like 0.064 and 0.0011, i.e., roughly about 2% of fluctuation level. **So I will _assume_ that we've obtained the following results**:

    # XCENTER YCENTER       SKY    SKYSIGMA    FWHM   COUNTS     MAG
      1034.76 1036.13       0.064     0.0011    2.99      2.9  -1.138
      1007.33  990.14       0.064     0.0011    3.01      0.8   0.199
      1016.51 1004.80       0.064     0.0011    2.90      0.2   1.752
      1048.00  942.55       0.064     0.0011    3.04      2.0  -0.767
      1074.63  939.88       0.064     0.0011    3.02      1.2  -0.221
      1136.91  947.06       0.064     0.0011    2.97      4.6  -1.652


* **Question**: When doing photometry (which we'll do in next section), people prefer `DAOEDIT` over `IMEXAM`. Why do you think so? Can you see what is the major difference between the outputs of these two?

  ​

## 8. More on Photometry

What you have obtained from `IMEXAM` and `DAOEDIT` are very primitive results. In theory, the seeing effect should be nearly identical to all the point sources in the image, so we should have same FWHM for each star. What we do is to accept average of the FWHMs of the stars I got above. You may have now realized that we had to choose stars that are quite isolated! If there is another star near it, then its profile may have been polluted, and thus the FWHM is unreliable. 

Let me show you how to get photometry result using `FWHM=3` (pixels). 

### Using IRAF `PHOT`

    --> epar phot

Then set the parameters as in the figure below.

(You can open up the parameter editor of DATAPARS, etc, by clicking on the `PSET datapars` OR typing `--> epar datapars`.)

![IRAF_PHOT_1](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_PHOT_1.png)

You can hit `Save & Quit` after setting all the values. They are explained below:

Parameters in [`PHOT`](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?phot.hlp) will be used for the aperture photometry:

* `image`: The input image name
* `interactive`, `radplot`: You will see what we can do if you choose `interactive` mode. It is recommended to check "yes" to both of these.
* `verify`: You can easily see what will be shown or hidden if you check `yes/no`. If `yes`, it **re-asks** about the parameters.
* `verbose`: The word **verbose** means "display the results so that I can see what you are doing!" in computer world. 

Parameters in [`DATAPARS`](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?datapars.hlp) will be used for the flux calculation:

* `fwhmpsf`: The FWHM we obtained from above (3.0)
* `sigma`: The uncertainty in sky estimation (0.0011). This will not be used depending on `salgorithm` of `FITSKYPARS`. See below.
* `ccdread`, `gain`, `exptime`: Put the header keywords, not the actual values.
 * In our case, the image does not contain the header for readout noise, so you may encounter warning from PyRAF when you run the task, but it does not halt the process. 
 * If you do not have the value in the header but still want to put, say, `ccdgain=5.0`, then you can use the parameter `readnoise`. Same goes true for gain, exposure time, etc.


Parameters in [`FITSKYPARS`](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?fitskypars.hlp) will be used for the sky estimation:

* `salgorithm`: Quite many IRAF users are unaware of the sky estimation algorithm. You will learn it while using Python, but you can refer to the manual website linked above.
* `annulus`, `dannulus`: To estimate the sky value, IRAF can only use method called "annulus". It means you are going to calculate the sky value and its uncertainty using the ring shaped region around the target (annulus with inner radius of `annulus` and outer radius of `annulus + dannulus`). 
 * Rule Of Thumb: `annulus = 4*FWHM`, `dannulus = 2*FWHM` generally works well.
 * More on sky estimation: IRAF does sigma clipping method to reject unrealistic sky values from the annulus defined by `annulus` and `dannulus`, centered at the target. To tune this rejection, you can change other parameters such as `sloclip`, `khist`, `binsize`, etc. You will learn what these do in the near future, and will make your own code to do the same thing.
* `skyvalue`: This will be used only when `salgorithm=const`.


Parameters in [`PHOTPARS`](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?photpars.hlp) will be used for the photometric magnitude calculation with `DATAPARS`:

* `apertures`: You have to sum the photon number within the aperture to get the stellar flux and thus magnitude. To do so, you have to set the aperture.
 * Rule Of Thumb: `apertures = 1.5 * FWHM` works well.
* `zmag`: The zero-point magnitude. You can set it to any value in theory, but 25 is used in general in practice.

After saving these, you MUST display the image by yourself. 

    --> !ds9 bf_KCD095628.fits &
    --> phot
    The input image(s) ('bf_KCD095628.fits'): 
    Warning: Graphics overlay not available for display device.
    Warning: Image bf_KCD095628.fits  Keyword RONOISE not found.

Hit `?` to see the help. Usually you will use `f` (of `space bar` if you want to save the result immediately). Some other things, such as `c` or `t` may be used.

* **TIP**: You MUST open the image on `ds9` which is the same as the `inputs` in the `PHOT`. It is a known bug and may not be fixed in the future.

If you hit `f` on a certain star, some kind of radial plot will appear with three vertical lines:

![IRAF_PHOT_2](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_PHOT_2.png)

The image shows the plot of pixel values (`Intensity`) with respect to the radial distance from the calculated photocenter of the star near the cursor. In the lower axis, radial distance is shown in pixel units, and upper axis shows the scale units. 

* **Question**: Why do you think I used aperture `~1.5 FWHM` ?
* **Question**: Why do you think I used such annulus? Why can't we use annulus from 4.50 to 12.00, for example in our case?

* **TIP**: You may want to see the x-axis in arcsecond unit. Then, if you knew 1 pixel corresponds to 0.5 arcsec, for example, you could have set `scale = 0.5` in `DATAPARS`.

The vertical lines show the aperture and inner/outer edge of the annulus to measure the sky. From the messages shown in the top of the image, you can read centroid result and the sky (depends on `salgorithm` you selected) statistics:

* `xc, yc`: The result from marginalized centroiding
* `xerr, yerr`: The error of `xc, yc` after marginalized centroiding. *I just guess these are calculated from Gaussian fitting to the marginalized fluxes (projection onto x and y axes)*
* `value`: The representatice sky value, such as mode, median, mean, etc, depending on `salgorithm`.
* `sigma`: The sky uncertainty (centered second moment)
* `skew`: The centered third moment (so called skewness)
* `nsky`: The number of sky pixels used to get `value, sigma, skew` after sigma clipping
* `nrej`: The numver of sky pixels rejected after sigma clipping

### Looking at the Results of `PHOT`

Now you must have a file named `filename+.mag.1`, and mine is like this:

Because it is too long, I extracted only the last part. The commented lines explains the name of the parameters (`N`), unit (`U`), and the format (`F`). What you will use most frequently are `XCENTER`, `YCENTER`, `RAPERT` (aperture radius), `MAG` (instrumental magnitude), and `MERR` (uncertainty in instrumental magnitude). 

I have obtained $ m_{\rm inst} = 25.852 \pm 0.080$!

* **TIP**: Although I have said that the small min/max of preprocessed image caused problem for `DAOEDIT`, you can see that actually they are saved internally and has proper values in the `.mag.1` file. 


### Saving IRAF Files to Normal Text: `TXDUMP`

Now, it is difficult to read by a human. So IRAF supports a task called `TXDUMP`, which dumps texts. For example, let me print `XCENTER` and `YCENTER`:

    --> txdump bf_KCD095628.fits.mag.2 'xcenter, ycenter' yes
    1070.161  998.227

You don't *have to* use capital letters as you can see. `yes` is actually the answer to verbose option. You can open up the parameter setting by `epar txdump`. You can save the output as a file as you did in LINUX:

    --> txdump bf_KCD095628.fits.mag.2 'xcenter, ycenter, mag, merr' yes > output.txt

and `output.txt` contains only the following numbers:

    1070.161  998.227  25.852  0.080

​    
* **TIP**: You may worry that this kind of IRAF-specific format of output file cannot be read properly from Python. But `astropy` has built-in function called `ascii`, which properly reads these output files even faster, more readible, useful, and fancier than `TXDUMP`. 



## 9. For Your Future... `DAOFIND`

Although I will not teach more on IRAF than this, you may need to learn using IRAF for photometry (even psf photometry) in the future, because many older generation prefers IRAF due to the *legacy*. I want to put one more information on `PHOT` task for your future reference and then the `DAOFIND`.

In `PHOT`, you may not want to do all the things interactively since you have 100 images with 2 stars of interest in each image (so that you need 100x2 = 200 interactions for the same xy coordinates). Then what you can do is to save the XY coordinate of the two stars in a file called `stars.coo.1` and fill `coords` of "`epar PHOT`" with this filename. The file may look like:

    1312.3 332.2
    132.6 423.6

First and second columns are X, Y coordinate of the stars found from `DAOEDIT` or `PHOT`. 

What this will do is similar to a mouse-keyboard macro program: load the image, put cursor at the given position, hit certain keys to measure and save magnitudes.

Now, what if you have 100 images but 100 stars in each image!? Doing `DAOEDIT` to 100 stars itself is exhausting. Then you can do [`DAOFIND`](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?daofind) or IRAF's own starfinder algorithm, which is not used widely. FYI: Same algorithms are also implemented in Astropy-Photutils, too. 

    --> epar daofind
    (settings is a simplified version of PHOT, so you can easily understand)
    
    --> daofind
    Task daofind is running...


    FWHM of features in scale units (3.) (CR or value): 
        New FWHM of features: 3. scale units  3. pixels

Here, detection threshold is the most important one. If the peak intensity of the fitted star (NOT the peak pixel value, but the peak value of the **fitted** function!) is below the `|threshold * skysigma|`, they are neglected and not considered as stars. 

After a while, a file with `filename.coo.1` will be generated with following contents:

    #N XCENTER   YCENTER   MAG      SHARPNESS   SROUND      GROUND      ID         \

       ......

About 20,000 stars are detected in my case. 

Here, `sharpness`, `sround`, and `ground` are the parameters used to determine whether the source is a star-like one or not. They are defined in the [Stetson 1987](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987PASP...99..191S) paper for the first time. `sharpness` is a measure of "how sharp the target is", and is kind of "peak value / sky value", roughly speaking. `sround` and `ground` are roundness parameters: `sround` is to measure the roundness based on the symmetric property of the source, and `ground` is based on the marginalized Gaussian fit to the object.





## 10. Spectroscopic Preprocessing

The preprocessing procedures are identical to photometry. One thing to be careful is just flat: flats should have identical filter, slit, grating, etc, with the object of interest.

We then may need one more step, i.e., trimming (cropping the image). Go display the ``flat.fits`` file by ``implot``

```
--> implot flat.fits
```

![IRAF_implot_vega_flat](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_implot_vega_flat.png)

* Left image: typing ``:a 30`` and then ``:l 700`` (average over 30 pixels around line (row) 700)
* Right image: typing ``:a 30`` and then ``:c 500`` (average over 30 pixels around column 500).

We may say that ``x`` (column): 500~2100 and ``y`` (line): 550~850 is reliable, and other pixels are useless. For smaller x values, there seems to be signal, but it is due to the higher order dispersion and/or due to the order sorting filter.

We can trim all the images (including the object) using the ``trimcor`` option in ``CCDPROC``. The trim region can be specified at (trim) by ``[x1:x2,y1:y2]``, i.e., ``[500:2100,550:850]``, in our case. You can do it by

```
--> imcopy image[500:2100,550:850] image
```

to overwrite the original image by the trimmed image.

## 11. ``APALL`` and ``IDENTIFY``

There are two cases for spectroscopic data:

1. The object is faint, so the sky lines are clearly visible (due to long exposure)
2. The object is bright, so the sky lines are not visible (due to short exposure)

For the first case, we can do the wavelength identification by sky line, and the second cases requires some reference (calibration) lamp images. 

For convenience, 

```
--> !mkdir after_prep
--> cd after_prep/
--> !mv ../pvega.fits .
```

The dispersion axis should be saved in the header for the IRAF to work properly. We can manually correct this information. First check whether the header containing the information:

```
--> imhead pvega.fits long+ | grep DISPAXIS
```

You can edit header:

```
--> hedit pvega.fits DISPAXIS 1 add+
add vega.fits,DISPAXIS = 1
update vega.fits ? (yes):
vega.fits updated
--> imhead pvega.fits long+ | grep DISPAXIS
DISPAXIS=                    1
```

Now the image has the ``DISPAXIS`` header keyword.



### Aperture Extraction

We use ``APALL`` task:

```
--> noao
--> onedspec
--> twodspec
twodspec/:
 apextract/     longslit/
--> apextract
apextract/:
 apall          apedit          apflatten       apnormalize     apscatter
 apdefault@     apfind          apmask          aprecenter      apsum
 apdemos/       apfit           apnoise         apresize        aptrace
--> epar apall
```

Set parameters as in the figure. If you want the IRAF to automatically find aperture (you can modify it later by yourself, but you can get an idea how it finds the aperture), you can just set everything as default with turning the background subtraction on.

​	![IRAF_apall](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_apall.png)

```
--> epar apextract
(Set dispaxis = 1)
--> apall
List of input images ('vega.fits'):
Edit apertures for vega? ('yes'):
```

If you hit ``?``, the command will show you the help page. Hit ``q``, and you may be able to get out of the help page. The following images show four basic steps you have to do first:

![IRAF_apall_2](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_apall_2.png)

The screens of yours can be very different from this!

1. Top left: You will see the plot "original". Hit ``w`` for zoom, and ``e`` for the lower left and upper right corner to zoom in. Hit ``w`` ``a`` to get to the default zoom. 
   * **QUESTION** ``e`` for lower left and then upper right. How would you then obtain the x-inverted zoomed image?
2. Top right: Hit ``m`` or ``n`` after you put the cursor near the peak, and IRAF will automatically find aperture for the profile. Hit ``d`` to delete some misplaced ones. Hit ``y`` key so that you can define the aperture size as the width at the cursor. Hit ``l`` and ``u`` to set the aperture lower/upper limit manually.
3. Bottom left: Hit ``b`` to get into the background mode. We now will fit the background. This is needed to subtract background from the source. Hit ``w`` ``a`` to go to the original zoom. Then do ``w`` ``e`` ``e`` to zoom. It is better to zoom small y range to see the background fluctuation as indicated in the figure (red marks).
4. Bottom right: The dashed line is the fitted sky (background). Sometimes the sky fit is very unrealistic, and you need to change the sky sampling region. Delete the original one by hitting ``z`` near the ticks (I-beam shaped ones). Hit ``s`` at the lower/upper for both sides (usually more than total 4 hits). Hit ``f`` to fit the sky. Type ``:func cheb``, and ``:ord 3``, and then ``f`` again to see the 3rd order Chebyshev fit. 
5. Hit ``q`` to get out from the background mode. Hit q again. On the terminal, you will see some questions. Type “yes” to the **GRAPHICS, NOT THE TERMINAL!**



You may have to answer for few times, depending on the ``APALL`` epar setting. Type return again and again until you see the following left figure:

![IRAF_aptrace](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_aptrace.png)

This is the aperture trace. The fitting does not look good, but if you see closely, the error is only few pixels order. But you may still want better fit.

Type ``:order n`` to fit the n-th order fitting line to the ``+`` signs. ``:order 2`` to ``5`` will be enough for most of the cases. Hit ``f`` to see newly fitted dashed line. You can delete some points by ``d`` and redo it by ``u``.

* Moving along columns, the center of the aperture should move, due to the imperfection of instruments. This “shift” is called the trace. The above image shows this “trace” value along the columns(x-axis).

On the right, the extracted Vega spectrum is shown.

What is remaining? We have to change the x value to wavelength.



### Wavelength Identification (Bright Object)

You may have the trimmed reference (calibration) lamp image. 

```
--> epar identify
```

![IRAF_identify](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_identify.png)

* Set ``coordlist`` to appropriate line profile text files. If you are not provided any files such as ``ne.dat``, leave it as default.
* ``section`` is usually set as ``middle column`` or ``middle line``. It will show you the middle column/line cut (1-D plot).
* ``nsum`` is to sum certain number of pixels (lines or columns) to eliminate unwanted features (cosmic ray, etc). Just use ~ 10.
* ``fwidth`` is the initial guess of the full width of the lines. If it is very different from the real line width, the interactive line finding may not work properly.
* ``function`` is to fit the pixel-wavelength relation. Usually it is safe to use Chebyshev polynomial.

The "desired" line spectrum of the lamp should be provided by the observatory. Since our observations does not, let me draw one figure from a public website:

![](http://www.astrosurf.com/buil/us/spe2/calib2/neon1.gif)

(If the image is low resolution, you may find “low resolution lamp spectrum” more similar to your image, such as that in [this link](http://www.astrosurf.com/buil/us/spectro8/spaude5_us.htm))

Now we have to let IRAF know what the wavelengths of about some peaks in the graphics. IRAF then automatically use the “peaks” data file to find all other peaks. Let’s see how it works:

![IRAF_identify_2](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_identify_2.png)

1. Left: Use ``w`` ``e`` ``e`` and ``w`` ``a`` to zoom the spectrum. Put the cursor near one of the peaks (e.g., the largest peak at 5852.49 Angstrom). Then type ``m`` (for mark). At the bottom of the graphics, type the rough wavelength value (e.g., “5852”). Hit return. At the bottom, there will be the found wavelength value. It is found from the Ne.dat file, using your input value.

   Do the same thing few times more. We will let IRAF's AID (Auto Identification) algorithm to find all other peaks based on the pre-defined database.

   * In some cases when you are not provided with line profiles (``.dat`` file) and it contains lines from un-cataloged data, you cann]ot use AID.
   * Hit ``l`` if you have provided line profiles. IRAF will automatically read appropriate .dat file (containing all possible line centers) and find all peak values. 

2. Right: After hitting ``l``, you may see a lot of identified lines as in the figure. The lines, however, are not always the real ones, since very small emission peaks may be in the line data file, too. **So this process is not always accurate, so you have to edit them.** 

3. Delete some marks by ``d`` where no peak is visible.

4. If you feel satisfied, hit ``f`` to see the residual plot. If there is any point with significant residual, hit ``d`` near it to delete it (X mark will appear). Hit ``f`` again and you will fit again. Hit ``q`` twice to quit identify.

Some shortcuts are summarized below (from [Documentation]( http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?identify )):

```
d    (D)elete the feature nearest the cursor.
n    Move the cursor or zoom window to the (n)ext feature (same as +).
p    (P)an to the original window after (z)ooming on a feature.
z    (Z)oom on the feature nearest the cursor. The width of the zoom window is determined by the parameter zwidth .
```

The ne_30.fits now include the information of our calibration. We now have to implement the object image file that *the image fits file has reference spectrum data as this neon fits file!* To do so:

```
--> hedit pvega.ms REFSPEC1 "ne_30.fits" add+
add pvega.ms,REFSPEC1 = ne_30.fits
update pvega.ms ? (yes):
pvega.ms updated
```

For check:

```
--> imhead pvega.ms long+ | grep REFSPEC1
REFSPEC1= 'ne_30.fits'
```

So the IRAF now will be able to change the x-pixels into wavelengths based on this Ne lamp fits data. This can be done by dispersion correction:

```
--> dispcor pvega.ms vega_final
```

Then plot:

```
--> splot vega_final
```

![IRAF_splot](/home/aaa/AO_2017/images/IRAF_splot.png)

* Left: Hit ``space``. You will see ``x``, ``y``, ``z`` values. ``y`` is the cursor’s y-value and ``z`` is the actual y value (flux) of the plot.
* Right: See below.

To study about a line (absorption, in our case), zoom into a certain region using ``w`` ``e`` ``e``. We will fit the continuum, and fit the absorption line. At the left- and right-most positions you want to fit the continuum, hit ``d`` at each edges.

At the bottom of the graphics, you will be asked about “Lines”. This means with which profile you want to fit the absorption. I will select Gaussian. Put the cursor near the absorption line, and hit ``g``. There will appear a small vertical tick which indicates the center you selected.

After you selected all the lines you want to calculate within the zoomed window, hit ``q``. Another question is Fit positions: just type ``a``. The next is Fit Gaussian width question, just type ``a``. Fit background? Oh yes: type ``y``. Then you will see a green continuum fitting line and red fitting line (absorption fitting line).

You can see the center, flux, equivalent width, and gaussian FWHM value at the bottom of the graphics. +/- will show you the results at next/previous peaks. r will show you the RMS of the background after fitting.

Hit ``q`` to exit. The same question will be asked for if you have other things to fit. Just hit ``q`` to quit completely. You will see “Deblending Done” message. The process we’ve done is called deblending, since we “deblended” line from the continuum.



## 12. Flux Calibration

We need to have standard star spectrum to do the flux calibration. The standard star data is saved in somewhere like ``${ANACONDA3}/envs/iraf/iraf/noao/lib/onedstds/``. I haven't yet made lecture note for this, but you can easily find simple example from [FOCAS Cookbook](https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/DataReduction/Cookbooks/FOCAS_cookbook_2010jan05.pdf). See section 5.7 of the cookbook.




## A. IRAF Trouble Shooting

### Errors: Messages That You Cannot Change `uparm` something
Check that you ran `pyraf` **at the directory where you have `login.cl`"**!

Many of the students ran `pyraf` where you didn't do `mkiraf`. In such case, you can "run" `pyraf`, but nothing will work correctly. Even `ls` will not work. If you had to put `!` in front of `ls`, that means you made some mistake.

### Errors: "FXF" or  "Not an Image or a Number"

The following error messages may be popped up if the image reduction had some problem:  

    FXF: must specify which FITS extenstion
    (filename) is not an image or a number

For check, do `imstat *.fits` and see whether the results are printed normally.

Possible reason for *wrong image processing*: 
1. I found many students wrongly did `ls *.fits > ~~~~.list`. Please open the `~~~~.list` file and check whether it contains only the desired fits files. These **should not** contain `bias.fits` or `flat.fits`, etc.

2. In other cases, students didn't remove the pre-existing bias or flat files. You **must** remove the pre existing files via `!rm bias.fits`, etc, before median combining. If not, IRAF automatically adds one more extension on top of the original file, which then doubles, triples, ... the size of the image.
